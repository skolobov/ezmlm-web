# Configuration file for ezmlm-web 2.1
# ===========================================================================

# This file is not just an ordinary configuration file - it contains valid
# perl statements that are executed just like any other perl script. When
# editing this file, be careful that it is still valid perl when you have
# finished (perl -w ezmlmwebrc ;-)

# It is divided into to logical parts. The first part configures the way
# ezmlm-web runs, and the second changes the language, etc of ezmlm-web. You
# can not arbitarilly exclude any statement, since the script doesn't define
# any defaults of its own. You could, however, always split this file up and
# include the parts with
#
#   require('/path/to/other/part');

# This directory will automatically be created if needed.
