Mail::Ezmlm:Gpg

Object methods for gpg-ezmlm mailing lists
(see http://www.synacklabs.net/projects/crypt-ml)

Install by doing the following ...
# perl Makefile.PL
# make test
# make install

One thing. For some reason MakeMaker doesn't like symlinks. Please make sure
you use the full cantonical path for the gnupg and gpg-ezmlm binaries.

Read the documentation by running "man Mail::Ezmlm::Gpg".
