Object methods for gpg-ezmlm mailing lists
(see http://www.synacklabs.net/projects/crypt-ml)

Install by doing the following ...
# perl Makefile.PL
# make test
# make install

One thing. For some reason MakeMaker doesn't like symlinks. Please make sure
you use the full cantonical path for the qmail and ezmlm binaries.

Documentation is in pod format. Please run perldoc Mail::Ezmlm::Gpg after you have
installed it.
